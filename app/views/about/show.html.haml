      I'm Torie, and this is my personal project for the 3rd module at Turing. My
      grandmother and I both have celiacs, and want to make sure that our medications are gluten-free.
      This is almost always a challenge, so I decided to make it a little easier
      on us by building Gluscription.

    %h1.text-center How we determine if a drug is gluten-free
    %br
    %p
      When you enter text in the search box and click "Search", Gluscription takes
      that text and searches a database for a matching drug (via the openFDA API).
      When it finds a drug, it checks if that database has a list of both active
      and inactive ingredients for that drug. If it does, it takes that list of
      ingredients and matches it against a list of ingredients that contain gluten,
      and a list of ingredients that may contain gluten.

      The lists that we use are the following:
