Gluscription is an application that allows users with celiacs to search for prescription and OTC drugs, and find out if they are safe. It was a two-week individual project for Turing School. It uses the OpenFDA API to search for drugs. The live version of the app can be found here: [http://gluscription.herokuapp.com/](http://gluscription.herokuapp.com/).

To run locally:

`git clone https://github.com/toriejw/gluscription.git`
